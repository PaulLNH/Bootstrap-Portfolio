                            <p>My name is Paul Laird, I’m a husband to a phenomenal wife, father of three awesome children,
                                the sole financial provider for my family, and I just quit my corporate job. This might seem
                                absurd but hear me out.</p>
                            <p>I’m also an outdoors enthusiast, entrepreneur, and web developer. I love being outdoors and staying
                                active, something my desk job would never allow. I find businesses fascinating! I’ve created
                                a couple small businesses myself and it’s something I truly enjoy. Being creative and implementing
                                a variety of business systems is not something I had the freedom to do locked in my office.
                                It was time to break up with that oppressive relationship I called a job. I didn’t walk away
                                from the paycheck, but rather I opened the door to my own creativity.</p>
                            <p>You see, to me success is measured by the lives I impact, the experiences I share and the memories
                                that are created. That is why I quit my job, to help people just like you.</p>
                            <p>If you have an interesting project you'd like to talk about, let me know!</p>
                            <p>Together, we will build something great.</p>
